This project is a web page that performs eight different encryption and decryption methods. The methods include DES encryption and decryption, Playfair encryption and decryption, Vigenere encryption and decryption, and Caesar encryption and decryption.

DES encryption and decryption uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which is a symmetric key algorithm that encrypts data in blocks. The algorithm uses a 56-bit key to encrypt and decrypt data.

Playfair encryption and decryption uses the Playfair cipher, which is a polygraphic substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters. The cipher uses a 5x5 matrix of letters to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Vigenere encryption and decryption uses the Vigenere cipher, which is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypts letters based on a keyword. The cipher uses a series of tables to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Caesar encryption and decryption uses the Caesar cipher, which is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher that shifts letters by a certain number of positions. The cipher uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt messages.

The web page allows users to input their message and select which encryption or decryption method to use. The page then processes the message using the selected method and displays the encrypted or decrypted message to the user.
